=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides MODS (http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) parsing and creation for MODS Schema 3.5.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 MODS::Record->new(%attribs)

=head2 MODS::Collection->new(%attribs)

Create a new MODS record or collection. Optionally attributes can be provided as
defined by the MODS specification. E.g.

 $mods = MODS::Record->new(ID='123');

=head2 add_xxx()

Add a new element to the record where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element (e.g. titleInfo, name, genre, etc).
This method returns an instance of the added MODS element. E.g.

 $titleInfo = $mods->add_titleInfo; # $titleInfo is a 'MODS::Element::TitleInfo'

=head2 add_xxx($text,%attribs)

Add a new element to the record where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element. Set the text content of the element to $text
and optionally provide further attributes. This method returns an instance of the added MODS element. E.g.

 $mods->add_abstract("My abstract", lang=>'eng');

=head2 add_xxx(sub { })

Add a new element to the record where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element. The provided coderef gets as input an instance
of the added MODS element. This method returns an instance of the added MODS element. E.g.

 $mods->add_abstract(sub {
	my $o = shift;
	$o->body("My abstract");
	$o->lang("eng");
 })

=head2 add_xxx($obj)

Add a new element to the record where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element. The $obj is an instance of a MODS::Element::Xxx
class (where Xxx is the corresponding MODS element). This method returns an instance of the added MODS element. E.g.

 $mods->add_abstract(
 	MODS::Element::Abstract->new(_body=>'My abstract', lang=>'eng')
 );

=head2 get_xxx()

=head2 get_xxx(%filter)

=head2 get_xxx(sub { })

Retrieve an element from the record where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element. This methods return in array context all the
matching elements or the first match in scalar context. Optionally provide a %filter or a coderef filter function.
E.g.

 @titles = $mods->get_titleInfo();
 $alt    = $mods->get_titleInfo(type=>'alternate');
 $alt    = $mods->get_titleInfo(sub { shift->type eq 'alternate'});

=head2 set_xxxx()

=head2 set_xxx(undef)

=head2 set_xxx($array_ref)

=head2 set_xxx($xxx1,$xxx2,...)

Set an element of the record to a new value where 'xxx' is the name of a MODS element. When no arguments are provided, then this
is a null operation. When undef als argument is provided, then the element is deleted. To overwrite the existing content of the
element an ARRAY (ref) of MODS::Element::Xxx can be provided (where 'Xxx' is the corresponding MODS element). E.g.

 # Delete all abstracts
 $mods->set_abstract(undef);

 # Set all abstracts
 $mods->set_abstract(MODS::Element::Abstract->new(), MODS::Element::Abstract->new(), ...);
 $mods->set_abstract([ MODS::Element::Abstract->new(), MODS::Element::Abstract->new(), ... ]);

=head2 as_xml()

=head2 as_xml(xml_prolog=>1)

Return the record as XML.

=head2 from_xml($string [, $callback])

=head2 from_xml(IO::Handle [, $callback])

Parse an XML string or IO::Handle into a MODS::Record. This method return the parsed JSON.

If a callback function is provided then for each MODS element in the XML stream the callback will be called.
The method returns the number of parsed MODS elements.

 E.g.
    my $mods = MODS::Record->from_xml( IO::File->new(...) );

    my $count = MODS::Record->from_xml( IO::File->new(...) , sub { 
    	my $mods = shift;
    } );

=head2 as_json()

=head2 as_json(pretty=>1)

Return the record as JSON string.

=head2 from_json($string [, $callback])

=head2 from_json(IO::Handle [, $callback])

Parse and JSON string or JSON::Handle into a MODS::Record. This method return the parsed JSON.

If a callback function is provided then we expect as input a stream of JSON strings 
(each line one JSON string). For each MODS object in the JSON stream the callback will be called.
The method returns the number of parsed strings.

 E.g.
    my $mods = MODS::Record->from_json( IO::File->new(...) );

    my $count = MODS::Record->from_json( IO::File->new(...) , sub { 
    	my $mods = shift;
    } );

=head1 DESIGN NOTES

=over 4

=item * I'm not a MODS expert

=item * I needed a MODS module to parse and create MODS records for our institutional repository

=item * This module is part of the LibreCat/Catmandu project http://librecat.org

=item * This module is not created for speed

=item * This module doesn't have any notion of ordering of MODS elements themselves (e.g. first 'titleInfo', then 'name').
But each sub-element keeps its original order (e.g. each 'title' in 'titleInfo').

=item * Heiko Jansen provides at GitHub a Moose-based MODS parser https://github.com/heikojansen/MODS--Record
